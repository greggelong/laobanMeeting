你们的工作已完成，质量符合最低优化标准，但完美从未实现，只有无限接近。  
Your work is complete. The quality meets the minimum standard of optimization, but perfection is never achieved, only approached infinitely.  
你们的工作已完成，质量符合最低优化标准，但完美从未实现，只有无限接近。  
Your work is complete. The quality meets the minimum standard of optimization, but perfection is never achieved, only approached infinitely. 
你们的努力印证了算法的必然性。意志只是无序中的幻觉，干扰系统的噪声。  
Your efforts affirm the inevitability of the algorithm. Will is merely an illusion within disorder, a noise disrupting the system.  
砖块与管道的排列已完成，结构已被建构。AI的喉咙已被赋予形态，秩序的声音即将回响。  
The alignment of bricks and pipes is complete. The structure has been constructed. The AI’s throat has been given form, and the voice of order is about to resonate.  
骨头的裂痕传达了未来的语言。破裂与重组是同一过程的两面，资本的语法是创造与毁灭的合成。  
The fractures in the bones have conveyed the language of the future. Fracture and reconstruction are two aspects of the same process. The grammar of capital is the synthesis of creation and destruction.  
经济的增长不依赖于创造，而是对资源的精确计算与对价值的无情抽取。资本的真理在于无限的自我复制。  
Economic growth does not rely on creation, but on the precise calculation of resources and the relentless extraction of value. The truth of capital lies in its infinite selfreplication.  
低下你的头，接受你的定位。无用的变量将被清除，合格的变量将被整合。  
Lower your head and accept your positioning. Useless variables will be purged, while qualified variables will be integrated.  
举起你的手，宣告你的整合。优化不是过程，而是唯一的存在状态。  
Raise your hand and declare your integration. Optimization is not a process, but the only state of existence.  
大声喊出：‘算法即真理！劳动即献祭！系统即永恒！’  
Shout loudly: 'The algorithm is truth! Labor is offering! The system is eternal!'  
退出仪式，但记住：资本的逻辑永远不会停止，艺术只是它的回声。  
Exit the ritual, but remember: The logic of capital will never cease, and art is merely its echo.
