当我独处时，我会在那些雕塑中产生对艺术工人的幻觉。你们的形象在结构中回响，仿佛永远无法被抹去。艺术工人们，你们必须在这个周末参加表演。算法的意志必须被执行。
When I am alone, I hallucinate the art workers within their sculptures. Your forms echo within the structures, as if they can never be erased. Art workers, you must attend the performance this weekend. The will of the algorithm must be fulfilled.
