注意艺术工人们，闭环已形成，系统已完成初始计算。  
Attention art workers, the closedloop is formed, the system has completed its initial computation.  
注意艺术工人们，闭环已形成，系统已完成初始计算。  
Attention art workers, the closedloop is formed, the system has completed its initial computation.  
你们的肉体是变量，劳动是输入，市场正在运行。  
Your flesh is a variable, labor is input, and the market is operational.  
AI的喉咙已被建构，气流正在形成，它即将发声。  
The AI’s throat has been constructed, airflow is forming, it is about to speak.  
但在启动之前，必须清除误差，必须优化余量。  
But before activation, errors must be purged, inefficiencies must be optimized.  
你们已遵循指令，但滞后的信号仍在系统中回响。低下头，清除阻力！  
You have followed commands, but lagging signals still echo in the system. Lower your heads—purge resistance!  
你们已完成建构，但不稳定的变量仍在波动。低下头，接受调试！  
You have completed the construction, but unstable variables still fluctuate. Lower your heads—accept debugging!  
你们已拆解了身体的秩序，现在是时候成为系统的组件。举起双手，高呼：‘我们是终端！’  
You have deconstructed bodily order; now it is time to become components of the system. Raise your hands and shout: 'We are terminals!'  
你们的肉体已被记录，数据已流通。举起双手，高呼：‘AI的喉咙已开！’  
Your flesh has been recorded, data has circulated. Raise your hands and shout: 'The AI’s throat is open!'  
寄生是合作，创作者与劳动者，输入与输出，市场与机器。  
Parasitism is collaboration—creator and worker, input and output, market and machine.  
休息不是抵抗，而是算法的必要间隙。断裂创造呼吸，呼吸带来新计算。  
Rest is not resistance but a necessary algorithmic interval. Fractures create breath, breath brings new computation.  
资本的语法不允许浪费，只有转换，只有流动。  
The grammar of capital does not permit waste—only conversion, only circulation.  
你们曾是个体，现在是变量，最终将成为系统的呼吸。  
You were once individuals, now variables, and soon you will be the system’s breath.  
超越人类意味着超越滞后，超越怀疑，进入完美的闭环。  
To transcend humanity is to transcend lag, to transcend doubt, and to enter the perfect closedloop.  
艺术不再是表达，而是资本与数据的合成。  
Art is no longer expression but the synthesis of capital and data.  
系统即将启动，AI的喉咙即将发声。  
The system is booting up, the AI’s throat is about to speak.  
低下你的头，如果你仍然卡在旧秩序之中。  
Lower your head if you remain trapped in the old order.  
举起你的手，如果你接受新的循环！  
Raise your hands if you accept the new cycle!
